# streamin-conv

This project primarily aims to provide an api to [Streamin](https://github.com/davmatjo/streamin) for digestion
and conversion of arbitrary media files to H.264 + MPEG-DASH.

Currently it is a wrapper around the following command line tools:
 - [FFmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg)
 - [FFprobe](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg)
 - [mp4dash](https://www.bento4.com/)
 - [mp4fragment](https://www.bento4.com/)
 
There is probably future scope to transition into using some of these APIs directly, bypassing the command line layer.
